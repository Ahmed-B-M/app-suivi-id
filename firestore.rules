/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Urbantz API Data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset prioritizes data access and assumes all data is publicly readable.
 * Write access is completely open, which is unsafe for production.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The Firestore database consists of four top-level collections: `hubs`, `customers`, `tasks`, and `rounds`.
 * There are no subcollections or nested data structures.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: All `get` and `list` operations are allowed for all collections. This means anyone can read any data.
 * - Open Write Access: All `create`, `update`, and `delete` operations are allowed for all collections. This is extremely insecure and must be changed for any real application.
 * - No Authorization Checks: There are no checks based on user authentication or roles.
 *
 * WARNING: This ruleset is for prototyping purposes only and is extremely insecure.
 * Do not use these rules in a production environment without implementing proper authorization.
