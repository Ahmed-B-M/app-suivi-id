/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Prototyping.
 *
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset allows completely open access to the database.
 *   This is for rapid prototyping ONLY and provides absolutely no data protection.
 *   It is CRITICAL to replace these rules with a proper security model before deployment.
 *
 * Data Structure: Top-level collections are used for each entity type: 'tasks', 'rounds',
 *   'categorized_comments', 'nps_data', and 'processed_nps_verbatims'.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 *   - All reads and writes are allowed for all users.
 *   - No schema validation is performed.
 *
 * WARNING: These rules are INSECURE and should NEVER be used in a production environment.
