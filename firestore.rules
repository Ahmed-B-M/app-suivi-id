/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Urbantz API data.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset provides open access to all data. This is appropriate for prototyping where authorization is not needed and data is intended to be public.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The database consists of three top-level collections: `hubs`, `customers`, and `tasks`.  Each collection stores data fetched directly from the Urbantz API.  Tasks reference Hubs and Customers by ID.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - All reads and writes are allowed.  This is insecure for production use.
 * - No user authentication or authorization is enforced.
